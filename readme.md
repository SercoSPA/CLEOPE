# üåç CLoud EO Processing Environment

## About CLEOPE
CLEOPE (CLoud Earth Observation Processing Environment) is the ONDA service dedicated to Earth observation products discovery, manipulation and visualisation via interactive [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/).

Supported by [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) kernel language, CLEOPE provides users with an integrated development environment where to create their own applications on the Cloud.

As an added value, CLEOPE offers a collection of pre-installed libraries and template notebooks to enhance the user experience with the ONDA data offer. 
The CLEOPE Jupyter Notebooks provide an interactive way to guide users in performing a series of operations on the Copernicus products available in the ONDA Catalogue, with two main purposes:

1) **Access to ONDA products via Jupyter Notebooks** <br>
A set of templates aimed at facilitating the following actions for users: 
 - access EO data using the [Advanced API (ENS)](https://www.onda-dias.eu/cms/knowledge-base/adapi-introduction/) and download products within CLEOPE workspace using the [OData API](https://www.onda-dias.eu/cms/knowledge-base/odata-odata-open-data-protocol/)
 - order products stored on the [ONDA Cloud Archive](https://www.onda-dias.eu/cms/knowledge-base/cloudarchive-overview/) using the [OData API](https://www.onda-dias.eu/cms/knowledge-base/odata-odata-open-data-protocol/)
 - browse geographical areas of interest using the [OData API](https://www.onda-dias.eu/cms/knowledge-base/odata-odata-open-data-protocol/)
 
2) **Analysis and visualisation of EO data** <br>
A collection of mission specific tutorials, which lead users into basic operations of data processing exploiting the Copernicus products available in the [ONDA Catalogue](https://catalogue.onda-dias.eu/catalogue/).
The current CLEOPE version supports Land, Water and Atmospheric monitoring applications: Jupyter Notebooks are available for [Sentinel-1](https://www.onda-dias.eu/cms/data/catalogue/sentinel-1/), [Sentinel-2](https://www.onda-dias.eu/cms/data/catalogue/sentinel-2/), [Sentinel-3](https://www.onda-dias.eu/cms/data/catalogue/sentinel-3/), [Sentinel-5P](https://www.onda-dias.eu/cms/data/catalogue/sentinel-5p/), [CAMS](https://www.onda-dias.eu/cms/data/catalogue/cams/) (Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service), [CMEMS](https://www.onda-dias.eu/cms/data/catalogue/cmems/) (Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service), and the [CGLS](https://www.onda-dias.eu/cms/data/catalogue/clms/) (Copernicus Global Land Service) component of [CLMS](https://www.onda-dias.eu/cms/data/catalogue/clms/) (Copernicus Land Monitoring Service).

## Availability
The CLEOPE Free service is available to all ONDA registered users upon request.
This service includes a basic configuration of the remote Earth observation data processing environment dedicated to the user, with a wide range of customization options. Because the computing resources used for the CLEOPE Free service have a limited computational capacity, only basic activities can be performed. Please read the [User Guide](userguide.md) for more information.

The CLEOPE Plus service is available to all ONDA registered users for a monthly fee upon request.
This service provides additional computational capacity, allowing users to exploit all CLEOPE functionalities.
