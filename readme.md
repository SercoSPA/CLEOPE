# Welcome to CLEOPE! 
**CLEOPE** (CLoud Earth Observation Processing Environment) is a DIAS-ONDA service of EO products discovery, manipulation and visualization via interactive Jupyter notebooks supported by Python 3 kernel language.

CLEOPE consists in a collection of pre-installed libraries and template notebooks to enhance users experience with ONDA data offer. All the examples are available in a shared environment with the aim to help users to easily explore ONDA services main functionalities, to learn how to access data and the way to approach EO cloud resources through Advanced API (ENS). 
Example notebooks provided into CLEOPE are split into two main categories:
  - a set of templates aimed at facilitating the data access on Cloud;
  - a collection of mission specific tutorials, particularly suited for educational purposes, which will help users to process EO data offered by ONDA.

Technical details are provided üëâ [here](#tech).

# The Workspace
CLEOPE **public workspace** offers collection of template notebooks aimed at easly introducing users to browse, inspect and download Copernicus products via the OData API protocol and DIAS-ONDA Advanced API (ENS).

### OData API provided interface
Via their own Jupyter notebooks users can easily download ONDA products, by specifying their ONDA `username` and `password` and the desired items. The download option is supported by the [OData API](https://www.onda-dias.eu/cms/knowledge-base/odata-odata-open-data-protocol/) protocol which allows browsing the ONDA Catalogue and then selecting and downloading EO products. All the downloaded products are stored in the üìÅ`local_files` folder accessible within user own CLEOPE workspace, unzipped and ready to be used.

### Advanced API (ENS) provided interface
On the other hand the [Elastic Node Server (ENS)](https://www.onda-dias.eu/cms/knowledge-base/adapi-introduction/) software providesa front-end to the ONDA Data Storage  which extends traditional Object Storages API by exposing standard Directories and Files. Within CLEOPE a dedicated ENS access point exposing products in their native format is provided to users that want to directly access products and process them. 

## Default directory tree

### Shared resources
üìÅ `modules` folder collects the main libraries related to the set of template notebooks provided within CLEOPE workspace.
- Modules aimed at the **data access** are:
    - `aoi.py`, `buttons.py` and `empty.py`, which are specific scripts interfaced with the geographical research of products via Jupyter Notebook;
    - `qm.py` which is a module dedicated to the product **search**, **order** and **download** via Jupyter Notebooks. <br>
    
- Modules dedicated to **EO data processing** are scripts called in the mission dedicated notebook.
    - `cams.py`, `cgls.py` and `cmems.py` are named after the mission they are dedicated to - Copernicus Atmosphere, Copernicus Land and Copernicus Marine, respectively;
    - `data_processing_*.py` are named after the Sentinel mission of reference.<br>

More information on the mission-dedicated notebooks is provided üëâ[here](Trials/readme.md#mission).

üìÅ`output` and üìÅ`resources` are folders sharing temporary data (i.e. logs) and sample inputs for the template notebooks set. <br>
üìÅ`local_files` folder is the default destination folder of products downloaded via Jupyter Notebooks. <br>

#### Mission dedicated notebooks
üìÅüåéüåçüåè are folders collecting mission specific notebooks, showing some type of processing for Sentinel missions and Copernicus Monitoring Services, using the modules of reference. <br>
Full explanation of mission specific trial notebooks is given üëâ[here](Trials/readme.md#mission). 

# CLEOPE technical information
<a id="tech"></a>
CLEOPE is deployed as [The Littlest Jupyter Hub - TLJH](http://tljh.jupyter.org/en/latest/index.html) on OVH private cloud infrastructure provided with [ENS-legacy](https://www.onda-dias.eu/cms/knowledge-base/adapi-introduction/) interface, which allows users to directly access and process ONDA EO products.<br>
TLJH is configured with a **Python 3 kernel**, already provided with a set of additional Python packages aimed at EO data processing and visualisation with respect to any other default Jupyter environment.<br> Users can install any other Python package in their own CLEOPE environment via the `pip` channel in the way described üëâ[here](#packages).

## CLEOPE features 
Registered users' hardware features are:

| **Disk** |**RAM**|**CPU**|
| ------------- | ------ |-------------|
|20 GB|2 GB|2|

- **Disk limit** - when the threshold is exceeded an error message is printed out on screen, by both
    - command line:<br>`cp:error writing 'file': Disk quota exceeded`
    - GUI: <br><img src="Trials/media/disk_quota_error.png" alt="drawing" width="300"/>

- **RAM limit** - If users use more than the allowed amount of RAM, their notebook kernel will restart and a pop-up message is displayed:
<br><img src="Trials/media/dead_kernel.png" alt="drawing" width="300"/> <br>No other actions are allowed on the notebook in this case. Please note that shutdown unused notebooks is supplemental to helping with memory errors.

- **CPU limit** specifies the total CPU cores that each user can use within CLEOPE workspace. If the CPU limit is exceeded, computations may become very slow.

üëâ Please note that CLEOPE service can be upgraded to _premium_ according to our commercial offer (REFERENCE), allowing to increase the resources.

## Python 3 packages
### Installation
<a id="packages"></a>
Opening a new terminal, users can call 
```shell
pip list
```
shell command to list all the installed packages and corresponding versions.<br>
New packages can be easily installed running:
```shell
pip install <package_name>
```
or specifying the version:
```shell
pip install <package_name>==<version>
```
### Add modules to the local path
By default, Python looks for its modules and packages in its absolute `PATH`. Within a python script, users can add path(s) occasionally to the default path by adding the following lines in the head section of the python application or script:
```python
import sys
sys.path.append('/home/jupyter-user/directory')
```
